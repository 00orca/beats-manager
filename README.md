# beats-manager
small lil project to get better with python

Quick little script to sort your beats by year and month in folders

planning to add exceptions for certain file you might not want to move

Will be adding a script to rename beats with their bpm and key
more fun stuff later hopefully

# manual


1. put the path to your beats folder in the my_path variable

    don't put this file into your beats folder otherwise it'll get sorted and it's going to mess up the execution

2. execute the script it should sort your beats into by years and by months
